# College Resource Hub - Project Abstract

## Executive Summary

The **College Resource Hub** is a comprehensive full-stack web application designed to revolutionize how educational institutions manage and share academic resources. This project addresses the critical need for a centralized, secure, and user-friendly platform that facilitates seamless collaboration between students, faculty, and administrators in academic environments.

## Project Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust digital platform that eliminates the fragmentation of educational resources across different departments and provides a unified solution for academic material management. The system aims to enhance accessibility, improve collaboration, and streamline the process of resource sharing within educational institutions.

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture & Technology Stack
The application follows a modern full-stack architecture built on **Node.js** and **React.js**. The backend utilizes **Express.js** framework with **MySQL** database for efficient data management, while the frontend employs React with component-based architecture for optimal user experience. Security is implemented through **JWT authentication**, **OTP verification**, and comprehensive middleware protection using **Helmet.js** and **CORS** policies.

### Core Features Implemented
- **Secure Authentication System**: Email-based OTP verification with role-based access control
- **Resource Management**: File upload/download capabilities supporting PDF, DOCX, and PPTX formats
- **Advanced Search & Filtering**: Category, department, and subject-based resource discovery
- **Bookmarking System**: Personal resource collection management
- **Administrative Dashboard**: Content moderation and user management tools
- **Responsive Design**: Cross-platform compatibility for desktop and mobile devices
